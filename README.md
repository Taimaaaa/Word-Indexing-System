# Efficient Word Indexing and Frequency Analysis in C

## Project Overview
This project is a **word indexing system** designed to efficiently manage and analyze word data. It combines an **AVL tree** for dynamic storage and a **hash table** for fast word retrieval and frequency analysis. Implemented in the C programming language, this system ensures that word operations such as insertions, deletions, and searches are performed in an optimized manner.

## Features
- **AVL Tree for Dynamic Storage**: Ensures balanced tree structure for efficient word insertion and search operations.
- **Hash Table for Fast Retrieval**: Provides quick access to words for frequency analysis and querying.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Tracks how often words appear and allows for efficient lookups.
- **Optimized for Performance**: The combination of AVL trees and hash tables offers both dynamic management and rapid access.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: C
- **Data Structures**: 
  - AVL Tree for balanced word storage
  - Hash Table for efficient retrieval

## How to Use
1. **Compile the Program**: Ensure you have a C compiler installed. Use the following command to compile the program:
    ```bash
    gcc -o word_indexing main.c
    ```
2. **Run the Program**: After compilation, run the program:
    ```bash
    ./word_indexing
    ```
3. **Input Data**: You can provide text data to index, and the system will analyze the words, storing them efficiently and calculating their frequencies.
